## Background of Path Planning to aviation engineering
Path planning is a computational problem for a flight to travel from an origin airport to the destinated airport with a minimum cost and safest journey. It is a must for pilots to complete as crowded airspace needs a collaborative path planning in order to fully utilize the sky and provides a safe journey for passengers. Apart from the best use of airspace, path planning is also important for commercial airlines to reduce flight cost. Based on the cost index, a shortest flight cruising in less fuel consumed altitude can be planned, thus minimizing the flight cost.

**Python**

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
programming language, python is mainly used for web development, software development, mathematics and system scripting. Also, we can use python on the server to create web applications, connect to database systems for modifying files, handle big data and perform complex mathematics.



**Github**

GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.
